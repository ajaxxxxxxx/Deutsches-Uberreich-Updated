### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

natsynd_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Syndicalism)§!\n\nOftentimes referred to as Charter Totalism or even just Totalism, National Syndicalism describes an ideology that seeks to centralize the usually decentralized Syndicalist system around a strong central executive or authoritative body while supported by Nationalist tendencies. Pioneered by the likes of Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois, and Benito Mussolini, among other signers of the Totalist Charter, this new form of authoritarian Syndicalism seeks to safeguard the Revolution through any means necessary without allowing the weak and disorganized nature of decentralized government becoming an obstacle to national progress."

Based on the writings and thoughts of Marx, Engels and Lenin, the varied ideology - commonly also called Marxism, Lenininsm, or Marxism-Lenininsm to honor its main ideaologues and to distinguish it from other new alternative pathways to the shared Communist idyll like Broad Communism, National Communism, or Anarcho-Communism -  promotes revolution as a means of seizing power led by a vanguard party operating on the principles of democratic centralism composed of professional revolutionaries, representing both workers and peasants, who would establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, a phase of Socialism serving as a transition from the Capitalist bourgeois society to the ideal classless and stateless society: the Communist society. During this phase of Socialism the means of production would be transferred from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. The tendencies within the Leninist current may differ, but all Communists are united in their struggle for a better world for the proletariat of the whole world."

Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

Germanic Socialism therefore promotes the unity of the German people within a single Pan-Germanic state, united by the central figure of the 'Volkskanzler', guardian of the Germanic Tradition and of the People's Empire. The economy of the German Socialist state is organized in a corporatist manner, with national industries and private enterprises working hand in hand.

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

Furthermore, the economic determinism/materialist fatalism and total economic importance espoused by traditional Marxist and newer Syndicalist currents is entirely rejected, instead preaching a reform-oriented and pragmatic, humanistic understanding of Marxism and wider life philosophies, seeing this approach as the philosophy of praxis and an absolute historicism that transcends the traditional materialism and misguided idealism of normal Marxism. In opposition to mainline materialist Marxism, Gramsci preaches that a new cultural hegemony must be formed off the back of the Revolution and its ideas that truly represent the will and mindset of the global proletariat so that society can maintain order that is produced and reproduced by the dominant revolutionary class and the institutions of the societal superstructure they control."

Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob that - who hold that their crimes were an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement inline with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no moral basis and that such illegal acts were pursued due to one’s own personal desires and not some higher ideal. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies, using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a non-collectivist Anarchist utopia.

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob that - who hold that their crimes were an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement inline with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no moral basis and that such illegal acts were pursued due to one’s own personal desires and not some higher ideal. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies, using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a non-collectivist Anarchist utopia.

Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work.

Linked with Bellamy’s ideas of payment cards replacing normal currency and of ‘nationalist clubs’, or organized networks of Socialist political and socioeconomic groups working towards nationalization of all industries and the land itself, along with the peaceful eradication of private property, in favor of communal ownership in order to eradicate competition and breed fair equality while using a label less fear-inducing than Socialism to the American public, while also championing a new cutting edge of social rights and freedoms such as animal rights, wilderness preservation, reproductive rights for women, feminism, universal healthcare, freedom of speech and expression along with other personal freedoms and inalienable liberties, and so much more.

Centered around the idea that cultural hegemony - a shared and dominant internationalist culture that replaces violence, prejudice, religion, ideology, ethnic tension, nationalism, and more - must be achieved in order to control the masses and the passive Revolution in an evolved emulation of the status quo enforced by former bourgeoise elitists, Gramsci's Machiavellian Socialism dictates that violence, economics, and other forms of unjust coercions can never create a Socialist society adored and supported by the broad masses and wider facets of society. Furthermore, the economic determinism/materialist fatalism and total economic importance espoused by traditional Marxist and newer Syndicalist currents is entirely rejected, instead preaching a reform-oriented and pragmatic, humanistic understanding of Marxism and wider life philosophies, seeing this approach as the philosophy of praxis and an absolute historicism that transcends the traditional materialism and misguided idealism of normal Marxism. In opposition to mainline materialist Marxism, Gramsci preaches that a new cultural hegemony must be formed off the back of the Revolution and its ideas that truly represent the will and mindset of the global proletariat so that society can maintain order that is produced and reproduced by the dominant revolutionary class and the institutions of the societal superstructure they control."

radsoc_caponism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Mafia Socialism)§!\n\nMafioso Socialism, often just called Caponism or Caponeism after its leading ‘theorist’, is the ideology ascribed to notable crime lord and pseudosocialist Alphonse Capone, who rose to political prominence within the American Socialist movement during the Civil War. Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

This ideology combines the essence of Cossack identity and heritage with the principles of socialism, creating a distinct socialist system of governance. Drawing inspiration from national-oriented communist movements such as National-Communism, the Red Cossack Dictatorship emphasizes the importance of recognizing and preserving national and cultural peculiarities within the framework of Marxist and communist principles. It rejects cosmopolitanism and globalization, advocating instead for the preservation and autonomy of a Cossack culture. While the Red Cossack Dictatorship shares some similarities with military dictatorships, it maintains a distinctive leftist orientation and a focus on achieving socialist objectives. It may exhibit less authoritarianism and militarism compared to other socialist regimes. Some variations of this ideology may strive to establish socialism and maintain power until their vision of a just society is achieved, while others may allow for elections once reactionary forces are subdued. The Red Cossack Dictatorship aims to uphold the rights and interests of the Cossack class while pursuing socialist ideals within a national context."

The central tenet of Georgist philosophy states that although people should value what they themselves produce, the ‘economic rent’ - or all natural resources and other common goods of an area - must be owned equally by all members within a society. Putting forth that the only tax should be on land value, for taxing the economic rent only leads to inefficiencies and exploitation, Georgism is primarily concerned with economics, but has since been tied to ideas ranging from Syndicalism and Progressivism to Democratic Socialism and Left Libertarianism to certain strains of Anarchism and even non-Socialist ideologies in more Rightist and Centrist circles.

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

Finding its roots in the early 18th century after the Kingdom of Sardinia was ceded to the House of Savoy from Spain, the Sardism idea is also deeply tied to the Island’s form of monarchism and aristocratic pride, though republican forms do exist in some fringe circles.

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob that - who hold that their crimes were an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement inline with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no moral basis and that such illegal acts were pursued due to one’s own personal desires and not some higher ideal. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies, using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a non-collectivist Anarchist utopia.

In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society.

Calling for social safety nets and minimalist welfare systems, Progressive Conservatism seeks to improve society without radical or rapid changes to the established status quo and traditions, and is often tied to Catholic social teaching, Christian democracy, and even the papal literary work ‘Rerum novarum’ which calls for a form of Catholic conservative progressivism in order to safeguard the Christian working masses against the predation of Socialism.

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

Common in new nations like Togo, Congo, and Nigeria that have long been racked by regional rivalries dividend along ethnic and cultural lines forced to now live in an amalgamated nation, African Regionalism focuses on the development of a political or social system based on one or more ‘regions’ within a state, and/or on the national, normative, or economic interests of said specific region or other subnational entity. Similar to ideas of Nationalism but antithetical to their idea of total cohesion and equality across all territory, African Regionalism commonly fixates or prioritizes certain regions, ethnicities, cultural groups, religious sects, or peoples on a specific and personal basis unique to each nation and their reality, and is frequently seen in states and other recently-coalesced nations with a long history of factionalism, territorial rivalries, and ethno-cultural conflict, such as in Africa hence the name, but is also common in other regions such as across East Asia and the New World. Commonly favoring confederations and federalism over the idea of unitary systems and strong centralized governments, Regionalists look to places like the early United States, the Ottoman Empire, or modernized clannist structures as influences as they create a web of autonomous and semi-autonomous administrations within their national patchwork to create a modern nation state that fits the needs, traditions, histories, and unique differences of each constituent entity within the regionalist framework and their favored administrative entities or populations."

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Ranging from bandit groups with a state to organized military startocracies to even military-backed republican governments or pure dictatorships, Warlordism has less to do with politics and more to do with a lack of clear borders and the ever-present and often chaotic nature of warfare. Warlordism is frequently a transitory state, and is usually just a stepping stone on the road to a more clearly defined political system, though some pure warlord states do exist."

Not innately tied to a specific ideological current, Reformist Belgicism is primarily concerned with reducing the political autonomy of the constituent halves of its union while promoting national syncretism and bilingualism, though oftentimes each individual movement will heavily favor either French or Dutch for ease or out of personal bias.

Though not as established, historic, or rooted in ideology as true democracies, Democratic Warlordist systems still work to at least partially enfranchise the local population to some varying, usually small degree (often only giving the right to ‘vote’ to lower members of the organization and their families and friends, but more rarely to the wider population), while giving the masses support and some form of say in the soldier-for-hire-led government they live within, usually all to ensure the junta stays in control but rarely out of the humanism or kindness of the leading group.

This idea of Pan-Māori unity however is far from united itself, with varied kotahitanga sub-movements seeking to unite the tangata whenua - or ‘people of the land’ - using a myriad of possible unifying factors over the years; be it religion, democratic parliamentarianism, shared history and culture, an attempt at fostering modern Māori nationalism, or some other nebulous factor. Now, the Pan-Māori idea is largely championed by the elective monarchist Kīngitanga movement, started by the Waikato Tainui tribal waka confederation of Te Ika-a-Māui under first Māori King Pōtatau Te Wherowhero in the 1850s. They now stand as the main, but not only, group carrying the modern kotahitanga torch as they try to unite the various iwi of Aotearoa under a shared ‘Te Kīngi’ of the elected Te Wherowhero dynasty.

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

First theorized by German socialist theorist Ferdinand Lassale with his idea of the Nachtwächterstaat - a system inspired by the watchman system of public-organized militias separate from the government that protected towns and cities starting in Europe’s medieval period - Minarchism treads the line between State and Statelessness, arguing that Anarcho-Capitalism and other forms of total Anarchism are impractical as they cannot enforce the non-aggression principle, while total State control strips liberty and freedom from all beneath its gaze. As such, Minarchists tread this tightrope carefully as they use the night-watchman system to provide the masses a form of court system, military, and police force not originating from the State, but from the free masses themselves, creating a society free from tyranny that maintains the NAP and protects the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, enforcing property laws, and other encroachments on their inalienable freedoms, liberties, and rights."

Neo-Confucianism is an attempt at creating a more rationalist and secular form of Confucianism, being highly critical of East Asian faiths such as Taoism and Buddhism, and especially opposed to the newer faiths of the encroaching West. Seeing metaphysics, or philosophies dealing with the fundamental nature of reality, as a catalyst for spiritual development, religious enlightenment, and even immortality, Neo-Confucianists use this philosophy as a guide for creating an ethical and rational ideology based on modernized traditionalism, familial values and Confucianist socio-economic ideas such as gaining wealth over the generations in a ‘posterity through offspring’ system as opposed to the instant gratification of Western Liberal Capitalism, the pursuit of social harmony, humanism, and secular rationalism supported by non-intrusive spiritualisms and religions, among other more varied and less-widely agreed up ideas on politics and socio-economics such as cultural exceptionalism, civic or ethnic nationalism, class cooperation, and mercantilist, corporatist, communalist, humanist, or even neo-feudalist financial systems.

Common in new nations like Togo, Congo, and Nigeria that have long been racked by regional rivalries dividend along ethnic and cultural lines forced to now live in an amalgamated nation, African Regionalism focuses on the development of a political or social system based on one or more ‘regions’ within a state, and/or on the national, normative, or economic interests of said specific region or other subnational entity. Similar to ideas of Nationalism but antithetical to their idea of total cohesion and equality across all territory, African Regionalism commonly fixates or prioritizes certain regions, ethnicities, cultural groups, religious sects, or peoples on a specific and personal basis unique to each nation and their reality, and is frequently seen in states and other recently-coalesced nations with a long history of factionalism, territorial rivalries, and ethno-cultural conflict, such as in Africa hence the name, but is also common in other regions such as across East Asia and the New World.

In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society.

Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Though not as established, historic, or rooted in ideology as true democracies, Democratic Warlordist systems still work to at least partially enfranchise the local population to some varying, usually small degree (often only giving the right to ‘vote’ to lower members of the organization and their families and friends, but more rarely to the wider population), while giving the masses support and some form of say in the soldier-for-hire-led government they live within, usually all to ensure the junta stays in control but rarely out of the humanism or kindness of the leading group. Often disorganized and lacking the moral fiber of a true democracy, Mercenary Democracies straddle the line between benevolent military dictatorship and profit-addicted juntaism while supported by a weakened but surviving plural and mass decision-making process."

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of traditional Roerichism, the dedication to traditionalist values, the right to self-determination, and non-ideological pragmatism while using spiritual morality and guidance to guide humanity to virtue and prosperity. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

It is deeply rooted in the Kuban People's Republic and the Almighty Don Host, and revolves around the concept of power being concentrated in the hands of the Cossacks. In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society. This exclusivity solidifies the dominant position of the Cossacks within the political structure and ensures their continued influence. Unlike traditional democratic ideologies, Cossack Democracy does not aim for broad-based inclusivity. Instead, it emphasizes the preservation and promotion of Cossack interests within a democratic framework."

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Calling for expanded property ownership, the primacy of family farming, political decentralization, and conservative egalitarianism, Jeffersonian Agrarianism is a syncretic movement that combines Right-wing values and morals with Left-wing attitudes towards aiding the working class without falling prey to venomous Socialism or Liberalism. Staunchly anti-Elitist, this American variant also largely supports the ideals of former President Andrew Jackson, as well as Jeffersonianism, Utilitarianism, Classical Liberalism, Liberal Conservatism, Populism, Laissez-Faire economics, and the American ideal of Manifest Destiny amid claims that it is also racially motivated and wildly Nationalist while accelerating Jeffersonian notions of a strong executive to Jacksonian ideas of a near-supreme one."

In the case of places like Fiume, the Dual Cities were pushed to the brink, resorting to piracy in a bid to keep themselves afloat, both literally and financially. Due to its bellicose nature, Pirate Republicanism is usually incredibly strict and very loyalty-based, only promoting those of the highest merit with little regard to birth. Direct Democracy is used on board ships and within the army, but there are no elections to elect the Dual Governor or the city council in the case of Fiume, or the governments of other similar regimes.

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire.

First theorized by German socialist theorist Ferdinand Lassale with his idea of the Nachtwächterstaat - a system inspired by the watchman system of public-organized militias separate from the government that protected towns and cities starting in Europe’s medieval period - Minarchism treads the line between State and Statelessness, arguing that Anarcho-Capitalism and other forms of total Anarchism are impractical as they cannot enforce the non-aggression principle, while total State control strips liberty and freedom from all beneath its gaze. As such, Minarchists tread this tightrope carefully as they use the night-watchman system to provide the masses a form of court system, military, and police force not originating from the State, but from the free masses themselves, creating a society free from tyranny that maintains the NAP and protects the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, enforcing property laws, and other encroachments on their inalienable freedoms, liberties, and rights."

However, this LVT is not spread across the entirety of society like its Leftist counterparts advocate, instead only utilizing it in plots and regions where it would be beneficial to the masses and the economy, though how this is determined, who determines it (whether it be private companies, the public, or the State), and the extent of its use varies greatly based on the group and their ideological biases. Split between a more conservative strain that pushes for limited social spending financed by the concept of rent value capture that only captures a portion of the land rent while the rest is kept by the government for funding purposes, and the Geolibertarian position that demands that all excess rents should instead be gathered and distributed among the masses, Right Georgism is a varied and ever-evolving thoughtform that has begun to form the foundation of a number of budding movements across the non-Socialist spectrum."

While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work.

Deeply nostalgic of the German Empire and the Germans outside its borders, proponents of Völkisch Communitarianism have placed democracy into lower institutions and support a Dollfussian corporatist scheme for a bicameral legislature. Typically connected to the Austrian far-right, there exists two spheres of Völkisch Communitarianism: the more Totalist version, supported by Walter Riehl and his right hand Josef Leopold, and the right-wing school of Frauenfeld and the pro-monarchy fringe stance of Eduard Glaise-Horstenau.\nThe DAP, and therefore any supporters of Völkisch Communitarianism, are very  pro-union and find meaning and passion in their toiling and teaching. They view the proletariat, though, a tumor from a great, cultured working class. The Totalist school, by extension, sticks more to the core teachings of the ideology, while the National Populist school has radicalized and emphasized the German Völk."

Furthermore, the ideology preaches that the British throne is the direct continuation of the Davidic throne of Israel and that the British Royal Family are the direct blood descendants of King David of Judah, that the Stone of Scone used in British coronations is the pillow stone of the bible that Jacob slept on and was later used in David’s coronation, that Britain and the United States are the inheritor’s of Jacob’s birthright through the Tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, and that most modern Israelites spread across the world like the Britons are not Jews.
