# Deutsches-Ãœberreich [v1.6]

A submod for Kaiserredux being updated by me.

> ## How to Install:
> The folder that stores mods for the game is:

> * Windows: ...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\
> * Linux: ~/.paradoxinteractive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/ or ~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/
> * Mac: ~/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/

> Manually downloaded mods should include a .mod text file along with a folder. If so, the files can simply be dropped into the mod file. If one is downloading a newer > version of a mod they already have installed, one should remove the older files first.
